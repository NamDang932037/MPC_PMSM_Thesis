# MPC_PMSM_Thesis
This is my undergraduate thesis project, which focuses on implementing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for trajectory tracking of position and velocity on a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM). The control is based on a mechanical model of the PMSM.
The project successfully integrates the following components on the STM32H747 microcontroller:
MPC for trajectory tracking
Field-Oriented Control (FOC) for current regulation
Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) for inverter control

âœ… Achieved Results:
Maximum position tracking error: 2 degrees
Maximum steady-state position error: 0.25 degrees
Velocity tracking RMS error: under 5 rpm

This repository contains the full implementation and related materials for the project.
